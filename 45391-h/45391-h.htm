    <p>
      a. "Billy," a tin pot for making tea in.
    </p>
    <p>
      b. Young gentlemen getting their "colonial experience" in the bush are
      called "jackeroos" by the station-hands. The term is seldom heard except
      in the remote "back-blocks" of the interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      c. It was formerly the practice of squatters to give a ration of flour,
      mutton, and, occasionally, tea and sugar, to all persons travelling
      ostensibly in search of work. The custom, however, as might have been
      expected, became frightfully abused by loafers, and has of late fallen
      into disuse, to the intense disgust of the tramping fraternity in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      d. The Yanko is a noted sheep-station in the Murrumbidge district (the
      Paradise of loafers), where travellers were, and, I believe, still are,
      feasted at the expense of the owners, on a scale of great magnificence,
      and somewhat mistaken liberality.
    </p>
    <p>
      e. The utterly refined and unsophisticated reader is informed that to
      "whip the cat" signifies, in nautical parlance, to weep or lament.

    <h2>
      AUTHOR'S PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> AM assured that
      something in the way of an apologetic preface is always expected from a
      "new-chum" author who has had the hardihood to jump his Pegasus over the
      paddock fence (so to speak), and drop, uninvited, into the field of
      letters; and so, having induced a publisher, in a moment of weakness, to
      bring me before the public, it behoves me to conciliate that
      long-suffering body by conforming to all established rules. I am aware
      that my excuse for inflicting this work on mankind is somewhat "thin" but,
      such as it is, I will proceed to state it, as a "plea in bar" against all
      active and offensive expressions of indignation on the part of outraged
      humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having "got me some ideas," as Mr Emmett says in the character of "Fritz,"
      and feeling the necessity for inflicting them on somebody imminent, I
      tried their effect on my own immediate circle of friends. It was not
      satisfactory. They listened, indeed, for a while, thinking that I was
      suffering from a slight mental derangement which would be best treated by
      judicious humouring. Some even affected to be entertained, and laughed
      (what a hollow mockery of merriment it was! ) at atrocious puns; but I
      could see the look of hate steal over countenances which had hitherto
      beamed on me with interest and affection, and was not deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that friendship would not long survive such a test and desisted; but
      it was too late. They perceived I had what Artemus Ward calls the "poetry
      disease;" feared that it might be infectious; knew that it was an
      insufferable bore to the afflicted party's circle of acquaintances; and&mdash;forgot
      to visit me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When their familiar knocks no longer resounded on the door of my lodging
      in &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; street, and their familiar footsteps
      ceased to crush the cockroaches on the dark and winding staircase leading
      to my apartment, I bethought me of that institution which I had always
      heard alluded to as the "kind and generous public." Here, I thought (for I
      was unsophisticated), is the very friend I am in need of, which will
      receive me with its thousand arms, laugh with me with its thousand mouths,
      weep with me with its thousand eyes, and whose thousand hearts will beat
      in unison with mine whether my mood be one of sadness or of joy; behave
      itself, in fact, like a species of benevolent and sympathetic Hydra, shorn
      of its terrors, and fit to take part in the innocent and arcadian
      recreations of the millenium, when the (literary) lion shall lie down with
      the critic, and newspapers shall not lie any more&mdash;even for money.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my hunt for that all essential auxiliary, a publisher, without whom
      the first step on the road to literary distinction (or extinction) cannot
      be taken, I learnt a few plain truths about my hydra-headed friend;
      amongst others that he was not to be hoodwinked, and would neither laugh,
      weep, nor sympathise unless he saw good and sufficient cause. I am in
      consequence not quite so sanguine as I was. However, I have gone too far
      to recede, and have concluded to throw myself on the bosom or bosoms of
      that animal and take my chances of annihilation.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my unsympathising friends assured me the other day that my book
      would certainly send anyone to sleep who should attempt its perusal. I
      gave him a ballad to read, and watched him anxiously while he skimmed a
      page or two. <i>He</i> did not sleep&mdash;not he, but a raging thirst
      overcame him at the fourteenth verse, and he begged me to send for a jug
      of "half-and-half" with such earnestness that a new and dreadful
      apprehension filled my breast. If this was to be the effect of my work on
      the Public at large, I should empty the Temperance Hall, and fill the
      Inebriate Asylum in six months! As I had hitherto prided myself that my
      work was entirely free from any immoral tendency, I earnestly hoped that
      his organization was a peculiar one, and that its effect on him was
      exceptional, and not; likely to happen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleep, indeed! Would that these pages might be found to possess the subtle
      power of inducing "tired Nature's sweet restorer" to visit the weary
      eyelids of knocked-up humanity; that they might become a domestic
      necessity, like Winslows "soothing-syrup," and "a blessing to mothers;"
      that the critic&mdash;pausing midway in a burst of scathing invective
      against their literary and metrical deficiencies&mdash;overcome by their
      drowsy influence&mdash;might sink in dreamless slumber, and wake to sing
      in praise of their narcotic properties, and chaunt their merits as a
      soporific.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, I would fain ask thee, gentlest of gentle readers, to look
      with leniency on the many defects and shortcomings of this volume, and to
      remember that the writer was long, if not an outcast, a homeless wanderer
      among the saltbush plains and and sandhills of Australia, and the kauri
      and pouriri forests of New Zealand; that, for seven years, the prototypes
      of "Ancient Bill," hereinafter mentioned, were his associates; and that,
      if these experiences have enabled him to touch with some degree of
      accuracy on matters relating to the Bush, they have at the same time
      militated against the cultivation of those refinements of style and
      language which commend the modern author to his reader, and which are Only
      to be acquired in the civilized atmosphere of a city.
    </p>
    <p>
      N.B.&mdash;I desire here to thank my friend, Mr. Henry Wise, of Sydney, to
      whom I am indebted for the design which adorns the cover of the book.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> beheld a shadow
      dodging, on the pavement 'neath my
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      lodging,
    </p>
    <p>
      'Neath my unpretending lodging&mdash;opposite the very door:

    <p>
      "'Tis that prodigal," I muttered, "who enjoys the second

      He it is, and nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Answering my thoughts, I stated, "'Tis the artist that's located
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, returning home belated, seeking entrance at the door&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain then 'twas no illusion, "Sir," I said, in some
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      confusion,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon my abrupt intrusion&mdash;Mr. Jones, we've met before;

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep into the darkness glaring, I beheld a radiance flaring,
    </p>
    <p>
      And a pair of eyes were staring&mdash;eyes I'd never seen before&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, my fear and dread enhancing, towards me came a form
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      advancing,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the rays of light were dancing from a lantern which it

      bore&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas a regulation bull's-eye&mdash;"'Tis a (something) Trap," I

      (Fitting raiment for a glutton) was the garment which he
    </p>

      And his vast colossal figure, in the pride of manly vigour,

      riling)
    </p>
    <p>
      I betake me to reviling, and a stream of chaff outpour&mdash;

    <p class="indent5">

      How <i>int'rest</i> would tell by and bye.

    <p>
      It's true I'd been doing the heavy,

    <p class="indent5">
      And going a trifle too fast;

      But, uncle, I know thee at last;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I brought thee a gun, and a pistol,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And borrowed a couple of pound,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then exit, and cheerfully whistle
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In time to my heart's happy bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought thee a regular "trimmer,"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I thought thee a generous man;
    </p>
    <p>
      I drank to thy health in a brimmer,

      And pretty nigh emptied the can.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I went with a mob "to do evil,"

      I laughed, and I danced, and I sang;

      And care and depression go hang.

    <p class="indent5">
      Or made it get into my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the Israelite's warning,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In spite of what Solomon said,
    </p>
    <p>
      You may <i>look</i> from the dusk to the dawning,

      And still toddle sober to bed.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      It wasn't from <i>watching</i> the cup
    </p>
    <p>
      I lost the control of my senses,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or, falling, I couldn't get up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Destruction again was before me,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And empty once more was my purse,

    <p class="indent5">
      And withered my half-uttered curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought that the mines of Australia
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I'd found in the meanest of men,

      I sought thine iniquitous den.

    </p>
    <p>
      My walk, though a little unsteady,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Was dignity tempered with grace;
    </p>
    <p>
      I playfully asked for the "ready,"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And smiled in thy villainous face.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I brought thee my best Sunday beaver,

    <p class="indent5">
      And gorgeous habiliments new;

      My watch&mdash;such a fine English lever!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I brought thee a coat&mdash;such a vestment!

    <p class="indent5">
      'Twas newly constructed by Poole;

      I've found it a losing in<i>vestment</i>&mdash;

      Oh! how could I be such a fool?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I told thee I hadn't a "stiver;"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I said I'd been "cutting it fat,"
    </p>
    <p>
      And coolly demanded a "fiver,"&mdash;

    <p>
      When cursing the year I was born in,

    <p class="indent5">
      I felt the first turn of the screw.

      How I'd been deluded and done.

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A message came swiftly to me;

      I trod the narrow track.

      I saw an object on ahead&mdash;

      It seemed to be a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    <p>
      A venerable party sat
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Upon a fallen log;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon him was a battered hat,

    <p class="indent5">
      And near him was a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The look that o'er his features hung
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Was anything but sweet;
    </p>
    <p>
      His swag and "billy"a lay among
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The grass beneath his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And white and withered was his hair,

    <p>
      I'd rather not have ipet the pair

      In such a lonely place.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought misfortune's heavy hand
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Had done what it could do;

      And on the dingo too.

    <p>
      A hungry look that dingo wore&mdash;

      I think I never saw before

      So lean and lank a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I said&mdash;"Old man, I fear that you
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Are down upon your luck;
    </p>
    <p>
      You very much resemble, too,

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      His answer wasn't quite distinct&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      (I'm sure it wasn't true):
    </p>
    <p>
      He said I was (at least, I think,)

    <p class="indent5">
      "A"&mdash;something&mdash;"jackeroo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he didn't want my chaff,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And (with an angry stamp)
    </p>
    <p>
      Declared I made too free by half

    <p class="indent5">
      "A-rushing of his camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged him to be calm, and not
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Apologise to me;
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me I might "go to pot"

    <p class="indent5">
      (Wherever that may be);
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And growled a muttered curse or two
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Expressive of his views

      New chums and jackeroos.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But economical he was
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With his melodious voice;
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the reason was because
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His epithets were choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I said&mdash;"Old man, I fain would know
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The cause of thy distress;
    </p>
    <p>
      What sorrows cloud thine aged brow
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I cannot even guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's anguish on thy wrinkled face,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And passion in thine eye,
    </p>
    <p>
      Expressing anything but grace,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But why, old man, oh! why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sympathising friend you'll find
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In me, old man, d'ye see?
    </p>
    <p>
      So if you've aught upon your mind
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Just pour it into me."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He gravely shook his grizzled head
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I rather touched him there&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And something indistinct he said
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      (I think he meant to swear).
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a gesture with his hand,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He saw I meant him well;
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he was a shepherd, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "A takin' of a spell."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he was an ill-used bird,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And squatters they might be &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      (He used a very naughty word
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Commencing with a D.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd read of shepherds in the lore
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of Thessaly and Greece,
    </p>
    <p>
      And had a china one at home
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Upon the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd read about their loves and hates,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As hot as Yankee stoves,
    </p>
    <p>
      And how they broke each other's pates
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In fair Arcadian groves;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But nothing in my ancient friend
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Was like Arcadian types:
    </p>
    <p>
      No fleecy flocks had he to tend,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      No crook or shepherds' pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      No shepherdess was near at hand,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And, if there were, I guessed
    </p>
    <p>
      She'd never suffer that old man
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To take her to his breast!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      No raven locks had he to fall,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And didn't seem to me
    </p>
    <p>
      To be the sort of thing at all
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A shepherd ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of all the history.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I'd studied when a boy&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Paris and Ænone, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The siege of ancient Troy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought, could Helen contemplate
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      This party on the log,
    </p>
    <p>
      She would the race of shepherds' hate
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Like Brahmins hate a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a very certain thing
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That, since the world began,
    </p>
    <p>
      No shepherd ever was like him,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      From Paris down to Pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I said&mdash;"Old man, you've settled now
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Another dream of youth;
    </p>
    <p>
      I always understood, I vow,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Mythology was truth
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Until I saw thy bandy legs
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And sorrow-laden brow,
    </p>
    <p>
      But, sure as ever eggs is eggs,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I cannot think so now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "For, an a shepherd thou should'st be,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then very sure am I
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who wrote mythology
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Was guilty of a lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "But never mind, old man," I said,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "To sorrow we are born,
    </p>
    <p>
      So tell us why thine aged head
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Is bended and forlorn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      With face as hard as Silas Wegg's
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He said, "Young man, here goes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lit his pipe, and crossed his legs,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And told me all his woes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he'd just been "lammin'-down"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A flock of maiden-ewes,
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he'd had a trip to town
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To gather up the news;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But while in Bathurst's busy streets
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He got upon the spree,
    </p>
    <p>
      And publicans was awful cheats
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For soon "lamm'd down" was he.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he'd "busted up his cheque"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      (What's that, I'd like to know?)
    </p>
    <p>
      And now his happiness was wrecked,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To work he'd got to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He'd known the time, not long ago,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When half the year he'd spend
    </p>
    <p>
      In idleness, and comfort too,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A-camping in a "bend."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      No need to tread the weary track,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or work his strength away;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay extended on his back
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Each happy summer day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When sun-set comes and day-light flags,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And dusky looms the scrub,
    </p>
    <p>
      He'd bundle up his ration-bags

      And toddle for his grub,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    <p>
      And to some station-store he'd go
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And get the traveller's dower&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pint o' dust"&mdash;that was his low

      Expression meaning flour;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For squatters wasn't game

      To give their tea and sugar out

      To every tramp that came.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The country's strength, he thought, was gone,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or going very fast,

      The glories of the past.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He'd seen the "Yanko" in its pride,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When every night a host

      Of hungry tramps at supper tried
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For who could eat the most.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A squatter then had feelin's strong

    <p class="indent5">
      And tender in his breast,

    <p>
      And if a trav'ller came along

    <p class="indent5">
      He'd ask him in to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "But squatters now!"&mdash;&mdash;he stamped the soil,

    <p class="indent5">
      And muttered in his beard,

      For every sheep they sheared!

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

      Now seemed to be a curse.

    <p>
      But from his language I inferred
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      There wasn't one in three,
    </p>
    <p>
      Of squatters worth that little word

    <p class="indent5">
      Commencing with a "D."

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! for my poetic lore,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I fear it was astray,
    </p>
    <p>
      It never said that shepherds swore,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or talked in such a way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The knotted cordage of his brow
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Was tightened in a frown&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed the sort of party, now,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To burn a wool-shed down.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me, further, and his voice
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Grew very plaintive here,
    </p>
    <p>
      That now he'd got to make the choice
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And <i>work</i>, or give up beer!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      From heavy toil he'd always found
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      'Twas healthiest to keep,
    </p>
    <p>
      And mostly stuck to cadgin' round,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And lookin' after sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But shepherdin' was nearly "cooked"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I think he meant to say
    </p>
    <p>
      That shepherds' prospects didn't look
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In quite a hopeful way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A new career he must begin,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      (And fresh it roused his ire)
    </p>

    <p class="indent5">
      With that infernal wire;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

      And sheep was paddocked everywhere&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      'Twas like them squatters' cheek!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And shepherds now, for all they'd care,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Might go to Cooper's Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he couldn't use an axe,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And wouldn't if he could;
    </p>
    <p>
      He'd see 'em blistered on their backs

      'Fore he'd go choppin' wood;

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Warn't good enough for he,
    </p>
    <p>
      And work it was a cussed thing
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As didn't ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He'd known the Lachlan, man and boy,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For close on forty year,
    </p>
    <p>
      But now they'd pisoned every joy,

    <p class="indent5">
      He thought it time to clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They gave him sorrow's bitter cup,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And filled his heart with woe,
    </p>
    <p>
      And now at last his back was up,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He felt he ought to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He'd heard of regions far away

    <p class="indent5">
      Across the barren plains,

    <p>
      Where shepherds might be blythe and gay

      And bust the squatters' chains.

      It couldn't be much wuss.

      <br />
    </p>

      Then drooped his grim and aged head,

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he song goes
      round, we yarn and chaff,
    </p>
    <p>
      And cheerily the bushman's laugh
    </p>
    <p>
      Rolls through the forest glade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hobbled horses feed around,
    </p>
    <p>
      We hear the horse-bell's tinkling sound;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sand beneath their feet is ground,
    </p>
    <p>
      As in the creek they wade.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hear them crunch the juicy grass&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The water gleams like polished glass,
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath the moon's bright ray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mosquitos form in solid cloud&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      They sting and sing, both sharp and loud;
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the prostrate forms they crowd,
    </p>
    <p>
      And keep repose at bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      We watch the stars shine over head,
    </p>
    <p>
      And lounge upon the bushman's bed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A blanket on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each feels himself Dame Nature's guest,
    </p>
    <p>
      Our heads upon our saddles rest;
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, with weariness oppressed,
    </p>
    <p>
      We sink in sleep profound.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sleep as only weary ones
    </p>
    <p>
      Among hard-handed labour's sons,
    </p>
    <p>
      With minds at rest from debts and duns&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      As only these can do&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the daylight's first faint streak
    </p>
    <p>
      Has lightly touched the distant peak,
    </p>
    <p>
      And o'er us where the branches creak,
    </p>
    <p>
      Is slowly creeping through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly with sleep we strive,
    </p>
    <p>
      And hear the call to "look alive"!
    </p>
    <p>
      We soon desert the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses caught and blankets rolled,
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Super's" brief instructions told&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      We mount, and scarce our steeds can hold,
    </p>
    <p>
      Impatiently they stamp.

    <h3>
      THE MUSTER.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e ford the creek
      and need no bridge,
    </p>
    <p>
      And climb a steep and scrubby ridge,
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, boys, there's a sight!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The "gully," by the sun unkist,
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath lies rolled in gleaming mist
    </p>
    <p>
      And flowing waves of light;
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet untouched by noon-tide heat,
    </p>
    <p>
      Like rocks where broken waters meet,
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis wrapped as by a winding sheet
    </p>
    <p>
      In billows fleecy white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onward, and soon the sun's fierce rays
    </p>
    <p>
      Will dissipate the morning haze&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He soars in fiery pomp.
    </p>
    <p>
      We skirt the shallow "clay-pan's" marge,
    </p>
    <p>
      Force "lignum" thickets, dense and large,
    </p>
    <p>
      And often-times we briskly charge
    </p>
    <p>
      Some dark "Yapunya-swamp."
    </p>
    <p>
      We gather first a quiet lot,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then off again with hurried trot
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon our toilsome tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each gully, range, and hill we beat,
    </p>
    <p>
      Charge every horned thing we meet&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      With ringing shout and gallop fleet&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And "run" then "on the camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      The shaggy herd increases fast;
    </p>
    <p>
      We know by lengthened shadows cast
    </p>
    <p>
      Time too has galloped hard;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twill try our powers, howe'er we strive,
    </p>
    <p>
      This most rebellious mob to drive,
    </p>
    <p>
      E're night-fall, to the yard.

    <h3>
      THE RUN HOME.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he order comes,&mdash;"Each
      to his place!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And homeward now at length we face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frightened monsters roar;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some tear the unresisting ground,
    </p>
    <p>
      And some with frantic rush and bound
    </p>
    <p>
      (Half maddened by the stockwhip's sound)
    </p>
    <p>
      Each other fiercely gore!
    </p>
    <p>
      We spread along the scattered line,
    </p>
    <p>
      Some on the "wings," and some behind,
    </p>
    <p>
      And steer them as we can.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's but one pass through yonder hill;
    </p>
    <p>
      To guide them there will need some skill,
    </p>
    <p>
      And try both horse and man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hidden object checks them there;
    </p>
    <p>
      The leaders snuff the wind, and glare,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then bellowing with their tails in air,
    </p>
    <p>
      Swerve madly to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stockman hears our voices ring;
    </p>
    <p>
      With easy stretch and supple spring,
    </p>
    <p>
      His horse bears down along their wing,
    </p>
    <p>
      The living mass he wheels:
    </p>
    <p>
      Too close he presses; at the sight
    </p>
    <p>
      One "breaks" and bellows with affright;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick swoops upon him, like a kite;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cutting thong he deals;
    </p>
    <p>
      It falls with heavy sounding thwack&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such din those mountain gullies black
    </p>
    <p>
      Have scarce or never heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knows his work, that well-trained hack,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor heeds the stockwhip's echoing crack,
    </p>
    <p>
      And sullenly the bull turns back,
    </p>
    <p>
      To join the hurrying herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out!" a warning voice has said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's 'Mulga,' boys, and right ahead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And now begins the rub;
    </p>
    <p>
      From some their garments will be stripped,
    </p>
    <p>
      And saddle-flaps and "knee-pads" ripped,
    </p>
    <p>
      And horses' feet in holes be tripped,
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they clear the scrub.
    </p>
    <p>
      You, stockmen from the Murray's side,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who through the "Mallee" boldly ride,
    </p>
    <p>
      Beware the "mulga-stake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis strong and tough as bullock-hide,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor will, like "mallee," turn aside;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in its savage, sylvan pride,
    </p>
    <p>
      Will neither <i>bend</i> nor <i>break!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once through the scrub, we don't care how
    </p>
    <p>
      Things go; we've got them steadied now
    </p>
    <p>
      And haven't lost a beast&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, far as ranges human eye,
    </p>
    <p>
      The plains are level as a die&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Our toil has nearly ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sun goes down, the day-light fails,
    </p>
    <p>
      But now we near the Stockyard rails&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      We've one sharp struggle more.
    </p>
    <p>
      One half the mob have never been
    </p>
    <p>
      (Forced from those gullies cool and green)
    </p>
    <p>
      In "branding-yard" before!
    </p>
    <p>
      We jam them at the open space;
    </p>
    <p>
      They ring around, and fear to face
    </p>
    <p>
      The widely open gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whips crack, and voices shout in vain;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cattle "ring," and strive again
    </p>
    <p>
      To force a passage to the plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impatiently we wait,
    </p>
    <p>
      Till one old charger glares around,
    </p>
    <p>
      And snuffing cautiously the ground
    </p>
    <p>
      Stalks through between the posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      With lowered heads the others "bore"
    </p>
    <p>
      And jam, and squeeze, and blindly gore;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a hollow muttered roar
    </p>
    <p>
      Pour in those horned hosts!
    </p>
    <p>
      Those posts are fourteen inches through&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      They creak, and groan, and tremble too,
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that pouring rush!
    </p>
    <p>
      They're in at last, the gates are shut;
    </p>
    <p>
      And falls o'er paddock, yard, and hut,
    </p>
    <p>
      A calm nocturnal hush.

    <h3>
      ECHO VERSES.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ome years ago I
      chanced upon a magazine article containing a dissertation upon a now
      almost obsolete kind of versification, much affected by Ben Jonson and
      some of the last century poets, in which the first two or three lines of
      each verse ask a question, and the echo of the concluding words gives an
      answer more or less appropriate. An amusing example was given in the
      article above mentioned, which was equally rough on the great violinist of
      the past and his audience, thus:
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      "What are they who pay six guineas
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      To hear a string of Paganini's?"
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      (Echo) "<i>Pack 'o ninnies!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I read this and a few other examples, and was straightway stricken with a
      desire to emulate this eccentric and somewhat difficult species of
      versification, and now with considerable diffidence, and a choking prayer
      for mercy at the hands of the critic, I lay my attempt before the reader.
      The following echo-verses are not on any account whatever to be understood
      as reflecting on the present or any past Government of this Colony. They
      are merely to be taken as shadowing forth a state of things possible in
      the remote future.

      ballad suggested itself to the Author while in the remote interior and
      suffering from a severe attack of indigestion, he having rashly partaken
      of some damper made by a remorseless and inexperienced new-chum. Those who
      do not know what ponderous fare this particular species of bush-luxury is
      when ill-made may possibly think the sub-joined incidents a little
      over-drawn. If a somewhat gloomy atmosphere be found pervading the
      narrative, it is to be attributed to the fact that all the horrors of
      dyspepsia shadowed the Author's soul at the time it was written, and, if
      further extenuation be required, it may be stated that he had previously
      been going through a course of gloomy and marrow-freezing literature,
      commencing with Edgar Poe's "Raven," and winding up with the crowning
      atrocity (or <i>alba</i>trossity) which saddened the declining years of
      Coleridge's Ancient Mariner.

      He bowed his neck and swore.

      No sighs escape his breast, no tears

      From out his eyelids leak,

    <p class="indent10">
      A black revenge to wreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He brooded long, and a fiendish light
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Lit up the face of Bill;
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the way to work on men

    <p class="indent10">
      A dark and grievous ill,
    </p>
    <p>
      And place them far beyond the aid

      Of senna, salts, or pill.

    <p class="indent10">
      By a deep dark, lakelet's shore;
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed beneath its lowly roof&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      He shut and locked the door;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he emptied out his flour bag
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Upon the hard clay floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Awhile he eyed the mighty mound
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      With dark, malignant zeal,
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, a shovel having found,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      "Their fates," said he, "I'll seal";
    </p>
    <p>
      And he made a "damper" broad and round
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As a Roman chariot-wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He soddened it with water drawn
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      From out that black lagoon,
    </p>
    <p>
      And he smiled to think that those who ate
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      A piece of it would soon
    </p>
    <p>
      Be where they'd neither see the light

      Of sun, nor stars, nor moon.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For when that damper came to be
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Dug from its glowing bed,
    </p>
    <p>
      Its fell specific gravity

    <p class="indent10">
      Was far o'er gold or lead,

      In the wavelet's curling crest,

    <h2>
      SOCIAL EVILS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> feel that any
      reader who has been long-suffering enough to accompany me thus far must be
      craving earnestly for a change of some sort, even though it but take the
      form of an oasis of indifferent prose in a monotonous Sahara of verse; I
      want it myself, and I know that the reader must yearn for it, even as the
      bushman who has sojourned long among the flesh-pots of remote sheep and
      cattle stations yearneth after the pumpkins and cabbages of the Mongolian
      market gardener. I am, therefore, going to write about social evils; not
      because I think I can say anything particularly original or striking about
      them, but because I must have a subject, and I know the craving of the
      Colonial mind after practical ones. I commence diffidently, however; not
      on account of the barrenness of the theme&mdash;oh! dear no&mdash;it is
      its very fruitfulness which baffles me; its magnitude that appals me; its
      comprehensiveness which gets over me; and my inability to deal with it in
      such limited space which "knocks me into a cocked-hat".
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as I write, things which may be legitimately called social evils rise
      up before me in spectral array, like Banquo's issue, in sufficient numbers
      to stretch not only to the "crack of doom,"&mdash;wherever that mysterious
      fissure may be&mdash;but a considerable distance beyond it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, too, each one, like the progeny of that philoprogenitive
      Scotchman, "bears a glass which shows me many more," until I am as much
      flabbergasted as Macbeth himself, and am compelled to take a glass of
      something myself to soothe my disordered nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      If every one were permitted to give his notion of what constitutes a
      social evil my difficulties would be still more augmented, and the
      schedule swelled considerably. I know men who would put their wives down
      in the list as a matter of course; and others, fathers of families, who
      would include children. Few married men would omit mothers-in-law; most
      domestics would include work and masters and mistresses; and hardly
      anybody would exclude tax-gatherers. Fortunately, however, these
      well-meaning, but mistaken reformers, will have to take back seats on the
      present occasion, and leave me to touch on a few, at least, of what are
      legitimate and undeniable social evils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at them, as they drag their mis-shapen forms past us in hideous
      review! Adulteration of food, political dishonesty, "larrikinism,"
      barbarism on the part of the police, lemonade and gingerbeerism in the
      stalls of theatres, peppermintlozengism in the dress circle, flunkeyism,
      itinerant preacherism in the parks&mdash;what a subject this last is, by
      the way, and how beautifully mixed up one's faith becomes after listening
      to half a dozen park preachers, of different denominations, in succession!
      After hearing the different views propounded by these self-constituted
      apostles, an intelligent islander from the Pacific would receive the
      impression that the white man worshipped about seventy or eighty different
      and distinct gods (a theological complication with which his simple mind
      would be unable to grapple), and he would probably retire to enjoy the
      society of his graven image with an increased respect for that bit of
      carving, and any half-formed inclinations to dissent from the religion of
      his forefathers quenched for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have neither space, ability, nor desire to tackle such stupendous
      subjects as political dishonesty or adulteration. They are so firmly
      grafted on our social system that nothing short of a literary torpedo
      could affect them in the slightest degree, but I <i>do</i> feel equal to
      crushing the boy who sells oranges and lemonade in the pit&mdash;who when,
      in imagination, I am on the "blasted heath" enjoying the society of the
      weird sisters, or at a Slave Auction in the Southern States, sympathising
      with the sufferings of the Octoroon, ruthlessly drags me back to
      nineteenth century common places with his thrice damnable war- cry of
      "applesorangeslemonadeanabill!" a string of syllables which are in
      themselves death to romance, and annihilation to sentiment, irrespective
      of the tone and key in which they are uttered. If for one happy moment I
      have forgotten that Hamlet is in very truth "a king of shreds and
      patches," or that Ophelia is a complicated combination of rouge, paste,
      springs, padding, and pectoral improvers, I maintain that it is playing it
      particularly rough on me if I am to be recalled to a remembrance of all
      this by the bloodcurdling shibboleth of these soulless fruit merchants.
      Can lemonade compensate me for the destruction of the airy castles I have
      been building? Can ginger-beer steep my senses again in the elysium of
      romance and sentiment from which they have been thus ruthlessly awakened?
      Or can an ocean of orange-juice wash away or obliterate the disagreeable
      consciousness that I am a clerk in a Government office, or a reporter on
      the staff of a weekly paper, and am neither Claud Melnotte nor "a person
      of consequence in the 13th century?"&mdash;unhesitatingly no! And if, in
      addition, there be wafted towards me a whiff or two of a highly-flavoured
      peppermint lozenge from some antique female&mdash;on whose head be shame!
      and on whose false front rest eternal obliquy&mdash;my cup of sorrow is
      full, my enjoyment of the drama is destroyed, the Recording angel has a
      lively time of it for an hour or so registering execrations, and I am
      plunged in an abyss of melancholy from which the arm of a Hennessy (the
      one that holds the battle axe) or a Kinahan can alone rescue me. And here,
      reader, I must conclude, for your patience is in all probability
      exhausted, and my washerwoman has called: she is a social evil of the most
      malignant type.

      AN AMBITIOUS DREAM.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|I
      walked about in Wynyard Square
    </h3>
    <p class="indent10">
      At four one afternoon;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I saw a stately peeler there,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      He softly hummed a tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The sun-rays lit his buttons bright;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      He stalked with stately stride;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      It was a fair and goodly sight&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The peeler in his pride
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And padded was his manly breast,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Such kingly mien had he,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And such a chest, I thought how blest
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That peeler's lot must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I noted well his martial air,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And settled that of course
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He was the idol of the fair,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The angel of the Force.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      No cook or house-maid could resist,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      I felt, by any chance,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That dark moustache with cork-screw twist,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That marrow-searching glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And o'er each little news-boy's head
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      He towered like a mast;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His voice, to match that stately tread,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Should shame a trumpet-blast!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I pondered on the matter much
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And thought I'd like to be
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Escorted to the "dock" by such
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      A demi-god as he.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I gazed upon his form entranced&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      He never noticed me,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For visions through his fancy danced
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Of mutton cold for tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

      'Till&mdash;Mary's labours o'er&mdash;

      Inside the kitchen door.

      <br />

    <p class="indent5">
      Ensconced in some snug vantage-coign
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      At ease he'd stretch each limb,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And feast on cutlet and sirloin,

      Purloined for love of him.

      Awhile the figure seemed to stand,

      Then waved a shadowy, spectral hand,

      I put the contents out of sight

    <p class="indent5">
      A stony-eyed examiner

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I softly cursed his form erect,

    <p class="indent10">
      His "specs" with golden rim,

      The common objects of the room

      My breast, the late abode of funk,

    <h3>
      PREFACE TO THE PIC-NIC PAPERS,
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>F I were asked to
      state the most noticeable feature of the social economy of Sydney&mdash;the
      thing which pre-eminently distinguishes her from other metropolises&mdash;I
      should, unhesitatingly, say pic-nics. I once held the proud position of
      occasional reporter to a weekly paper, and my mental calibre not being
      considered heavy enough, or my temperament sufficiently stolid to do
      justice to parliamentary debates, I was sent to report the pic-nics. In
      Sydney every trade gives one, and every private family about six in the
      course of the summer. Carpenters, butchers, barbers, blacksmiths,
      undertakers, even grave-diggers, all give their pic-nic during the season;
      and why should they not? Is it for me to ridicule the practice? Shall I,
      who have been received as an honoured guest at all (and retired to make
      three half-pence a line out of an account of the proceedings), splinter my
      puny lance of satire against a firmly-rooted and meritorious custom? I who
      have hobnobbed with the publicans, waltzed with the wheelwrights, done the
      <i>lard</i> i da with the pork-butchers' wives and daughters, danced <i>coat</i>illions
      with the tailors, and indulged in <i>soot</i>able amusements with the
      sweeps? Never!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have retired from the pic-nic business now, and though my reports were
      not masterpieces of descriptive writing, and never wrung even the smallest
      tribute of gratitude from those they were intended to immortalize, I give
      a specimen or two to serve as models to those who hereafter may be called
      upon to report pic-nics for journals, religious or otherwise.

    <h2>
      THE BUTCHER'S PIC-NIC.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HIS event came off
      with an unusual amount of eclat; merchants, members of parliament, and
      people of all kinds, were present; and if they were not all butchers, they
      all became squatters when the grassy plateaux of Correy's Gardens were
      reached. The pic-nic took place appropriately under a <i>ewe</i>-tree, and
      fortunately the <i>wether</i> was remarkably fine. Saws (wise ones
      excepted), axes, steels, and all other implements used in the trade, were,
      by common consent, left behind, and the only killing done was that
      accomplished by several fascinating young slaughter-men, whose hair and
      accents were oily not to say greasy in the extreme. One of these, who went
      in heavily for euphuism, told his inamorata that her heart was harder than
      his father's block, and the satire of her tongue keener than the edge of a
      certain cleaver in his parent's possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Loin Oxborough, Fifth Baron (of beef), estates strictly <i>entailed</i>,
      was unanimously voted to a deserted "bull-dog's" nest, which did duty for
      a chair. He occupied this position with dignity, and made a speech, <i>interlarding</i>
      his discourse with several choice <i>cuts</i> from <i>Steel</i> and other
      poets; e.g.,
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Reveal, reveal</i> the light of truth to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Steak</i> not thine all upon the die!" &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said they were met to enjoy themselves, and by their <i>joint</i>
      exertions to banish dull care; adversity might come, but what of that? He
      had always found that a round of afflictions, or a dark cloud had a silver
      lining, or rather a "silver-side," like a round of beef. He had often been
      in trouble himself&mdash;cut down, as it were, by the cleaver of
      adversity; reduced, he might say, to mince-meat by the sausage-machine of
      ill-luck; and he and his family had been once or twice regularly salted
      down in the harness-cask of fate; but, thanks to his natural buoyancy, or
      (<i>butcher</i>)-boy-ancy of spirits, he had risen like a bladder to the
      surface of the sea of despondency, and lived to pluck the skewers of
      affliction from his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He advocated morality and sobriety. He might say he had lived a moral and
      sober life, for though he had been a free and generous <i>liver</i>, he
      had always done his duty to his fellow-men according to his <i>lights</i>.
      His motto was "live and let live," except where dumb animals were
      concerned&mdash;those he killed on principle, as a matter of business; and
      he respected all religious sects, except vegetarians. He had been cut up
      by sorrow, and cast down by depression of trade as often as most men. He
      had seen beef at tuppence a pound, hides at 2s. 6d. each, and tallow at
      nothing at all (warm weather, and no colds in the head prevalent), but he
      had never lost heart; from a boy, hopefulness had always been a meat-tray
      (he begged pardon, he meant a <i>sweet</i> trait) in his character; he had
      persevered, worked hard, and had eventually carved his way to wealth,
      fame, and fortune, through bone, gristle, flesh, skin, sinew and all. He
      was prosperous, but he owed his rise more to shoulders of mutton than the
      shoulders of his friends. He had been self-reliant, just, and generous;
      and though he had flayed many a beast, he had never yet attempted to <i>skin
      a flint</i>. (Cheers.) He was not democratic, and he believed more in the
      horny-headed monsters than the horny-handed masses; still he liked to see
      a man rise by his own exertions; and, inasmuch as a king&mdash;Charles the
      First to wit&mdash;had shewn how easy was the transition from the throne
      to the block, he did not see why an ascent from the block to the throne
      might not be equally possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, he recommended his friends to take the fat with the lean
      through life, and not to grumble because some one else appeared to have
      all the prime-cuts of fortune, and all the rich fat of prosperity, and
      they only the fag-end and the bone. He sat down (on the deserted ant's
      nest) amid loud and reiterated applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festivities then commenced The guests sat on their haunches and drank the
      blood of the grape out of hogs' heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The toasts drunk were the "Gallus"&mdash;not the gallows; the block and
      cleaver, &amp;c. The juniors played "<i>round</i>ers," and (<i>raw</i>) "<i>hide</i>
      and seek." Dancing was kept up with animation until a late hour. Old Tommy
      Hawk danced a <i>porka</i>, and his peculiar <i>shambling</i> gait called
      forth rounds of applause. Several games of chance were played for beef <i>stakes</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A butcher who dealt largely in <i>goat's</i> flesh sang the touching
      Scotch ballad, "Oh, Nanny, wilt thou gang wi me," and old Pork Chops sang
      "Those evening <i>chines</i>" in a most affecting manner. The festivities
      continued until they could not very well continue any longer, and every
      body returned home perfectly satisfied.

    <h2>
      THE OYSTERMEN'S AND FISHMONGERS' PIC-NIC.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ON DAY was a great
      day. Though the bosom of the ocean was apparently unruffled by a zephyr,
      terror and excitement raged beneath its surface. Influential members of
      the finny tribe darted hither and thither in a manner which indicated that
      something unusual was afloat, and the piscatorial republic was shaken to
      its very centre. The military (that is, the sword-fish) were under arms,
      or rather fins, at an early hour, and formed a roe in martial array. The
      less warlike betrayed their agitation in a variety of ways. Sawfish from
      the Gulf of Carpentaria left their usual occupation of cutting the water,
      rose to the surface, and sawed the air in an agony of in tench excitement;
      mercantile fish abandoned their scales and took their weigh to places of
      security; limpets, becoming enervated, relaxed their hold upon the rock;
      oysters tossed restlessly on their beds, and even the jelly-fish trembled.
      Nor was this surprising; for were not the fishmongers and oystermen about
      to hold carnival&mdash;to celebrate the rites and ceremonies of their
      order? and, knowing this, could any member of the finny tribe remain
      unmoved, or even a molusc be calm?
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite, perhaps unconscious, of all this, the jubilant fishmongers
      proceeded to the enjoyment of their pic-nic with light hearts. The
      oystermen, most of whom were natives, were appropriately clothed in
      shell-jackets, and wore barnacles. Miss Annet Snapperton, resplendent in a
      sea-green fishu, with cochineel trimmings, and a sea-anemone in her hair,
      proved an irresistible bait to young Codlington, a susceptible periwinkler
      and oysterman. He swore by the beard of the sacred oyster that she was an
      angel&mdash;called her his turtle and his pet (limpet, in fact)&mdash;and,
      while he besought her to fly with him and share a "grotter of hyster
      shells," he stated his intention of adhering to her heart like a limpet to
      its native rock, or the teeth of a skate to the finger of a too-confiding
      fisherman. At the conclusion of the banquet a speech was called for, and
      old Grampus rose. He said:&mdash;"Fishmongers and Fellow-oystermen (hear,
      hear), to meat you here on this ausfishous occasion" [he lisped a bit
      after eating salmon] "eels the wounded spirit and warms the cockles of
      this heart. Star-fish and stingarees! May I be scolloped if this aint the
      proudest moment of my life!" (Cheers.) He proceeded to state his views on
      things in general&mdash;regretted that a more able speaker had not been
      chosen to offishiate&mdash;hoped they wouldn't expect along speech from
      him, as he wasn't a parson&mdash;in fact he understood more about the
      curing of herrings, than the cure of soles&mdash;and the only school he
      ever attended was a "school" of mackerel which appeared off the coast one
      Sunday morning when he was a boy at home. His father had on that occasion
      taken him by the hand, and together they attended that Sunday-school.
      Subsequent proceedings made such an impression on his mind that he
      henceforth resolved to become a fish-dealer, and became one accordingly.
      He had read his Bible, and had heard about the "miraculous draught of
      fishes"&mdash;thought it must have been a brandy-p(r)awnee&mdash;always
      thought fish were something to eat before, though lie had known fishermen
      drink their whole week's catch on Saturday night&mdash;was a sober man
      himself, and didn't go in for mackarelous "draughts" of that kind. If not
      a religious man, he always strove to do his duty! Though he had been a
      fisherman in his time, he had never been a plaice hunter, and, Ecod! he
      thought few M.P's. could say that. What were his religious principles?
      Well, he wasn't a mussle-man, and though he dealt, in shell-fish, he
      abhorred shellfishness. He had heard about some all-fired heathens who
      worshipped Zorooyster (? Zoroaster); he couldn't say as he was acquainted
      with that mollusc, and wouldn't worship him if he were. Oysters was good
      things if you didn't put brandy a top of 'em, and he believed in cockles
      (the molluscs, not the pills), but worship a hoyster! Thank'eaven, he
      wasn't so far gone as that! Such ideas was incongerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down amid applause, and musical and terpsichorean festivities
      commenced. Somebody danced the fishmongers' hornpipe. "Sets" were formed,
      and the (s)caly-donians gone through with great spirit. A gloomy-looking
      fish-dealer, with a bass voice, sang "My sole is dark and a
      blighted-looking young oyster-opener gave them, "Shells of the Ocean," and
      "Oh, shell we never part," alluding to the monotony of his occupation.
      Young Codlington sang "(T)winkle, (t)winkle, little Star-fish" with great
      taste and feeling. Fun and frolic became general, and it was late ere the
      (r)oysterers returned home, thoroughly wearied, but happy.

    <h2>
      THE WHEELWRIGHTS' PIC-NIC.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE man who cannot
      sympathize with a wheelwright in his joys and sorrows ought to be treated
      to a taste of lynch (or lynch-pin) law. No one with a properly regulated
      mind can fail to admire their round-about way of doing things, and their
      untiring energy; and no rightly thinking person could be otherwise than
      rejoiced on hearing the other day that these jolly good felleys had made
      up their minds to have a trundle down the harbour, and an afternoon's
      enjoyment Of course the party started from the Circular Quay, and took
      with them a plentiful supply of weal and ham pies and roly-poly puddings.
      They reached their destination in safety, and after a short walk along the
      beach, the order was given to "right-wheel," and they found themselves in
      a delightful glade, where the blue gum waved its giant branches in the
      summer air, and the luxuriant axel-tree cast a grateful shade over the
      holiday-keepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies&mdash;with complexions of a smoothness only to be attained by
      sand-paper in experienced hands&mdash;looked as fresh as paint, and shone
      like varnish. They were at tired, in elegant and becoming costumes. Spokes
      was nearly missing the affair altogether, as he woke late, and then had to
      dress, wash, and (spoke)-shave himself in a hurry. Old Wheels&mdash;and a
      wideawake old fly-wheel he was&mdash;drove down in his buggy with Mrs.
      Wheels and the four Miss Wheels, and, what with the front and hind wheels
      of the trap, the wheals inflicted by the avenging hand of Old Wheels on
      the horse's behind, and the young Wheels&mdash;segments of the parent
      Wheels&mdash;clinging on wherever they could get hand or foot-hold, it was
      estimated that there couldn't have been less than sixty or seventy wheels
      to the turn-out. Talking of traps, the four Miss Wheels constituted a
      four-wheeled trap for the hearts of men of a most dangerous description;
      and, after they had all partaken plentifully of the weal pies, there was
      weal within Wheels, and a complicated state of things which set
      mathematical and digestive theories at defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Wheels delivered an address, in which he stated that a bond of unity
      was the best tire for the public weal, and that if the felleys in the
      House wern't such a lot of (k)naves, they'd run truer, stick closer
      together, and endeavour to axelerate public business more than they did.
      He was proceeding to demonstrate that &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was no more
      use in the House than the "fifth wheel of a coach," when one of the
      younger Wheels began to squeak in an agonizing manner. It was immediately
      greased with some strawberrys and cream, and its (s)creams subsided into
      chuckles of gratification. Dancing, of the "turnabout, and wheel-about,
      and jump Jim Crow" order, then commenced, and kiss-in-the-ring, rounders,
      and other circular amusements, became general. A musical young
      wheelwright, on being called on for a song, suspended his occupation of
      picking his teeth with a lynch-pin, and gave them "Weel may the keel row,"
      and Axelcior." Spokes proved himself a capital speaker, and made the
      speech of the day, full of beautifully rounded sentences and quotations
      from Spokeshave. But all things must have an end unfortunately, and when
      at length the whistle of the steam-boat sounded for departure, the
      wheelwrights took their way homeward, happy, but thoroughly tired.

    <h2>
      THE UNDERTAKER'S PIC-NIC.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E have a special
      regard for undertakers. Watching funerals was the first species of
      dissipation we indulged in in early youth. We have witnessed Shakesperian
      tragedies since with less satisfaction, and have respected undertakers
      proportionately in consequence. But for them we should never have known
      how much of the latent spirit of tragedy there is in horses' tails and
      feathers, and we especially admire the dramatic style in which they
      proclaim to the world the fact that another saint has gone to occupy his
      reserved seat in the celestial dress circle, or another sinner sneaked
      into his place in that "pit" which is notoriously bottomless, and where
      the free-list is by no means "confined to gentlemen of the Press."
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding these views, we were naturally pleased to hear that our friends
      meditated a pic-nic, and we are still more gratified to be able to lay
      before the public the only reliable report of the proceedings in
      existence. The day was everything that could be desired. Huge masses of
      black cloud lay piled away to the south'ard, imparting a sombre and
      funereal aspect to everything, and the spirits of the excursionists rose
      in proportion. The picturesque cemetery of Haslem's Creek was the spot
      chosen for the celebration of the festivities, and the cheerful recesses
      of its cypress-shaded labyrinths that day re-echoed outbursts of merriment
      which must have been particularly trying to misanthropic ghosts. Every
      available hearse and mourning-coach was pressed into the service to convey
      the holiday-keepers to the mortuary railway station, from which a special
      train was to start at nine sharp, and the party in full gala costume&mdash;hat-bands,
      gloves, plumes and feathers&mdash;presented quite a lively appearance as
      the cortège moved down Brickfield Hill, the band playing "The dead march
      in Saul."
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the scene of the intended festivities, a luxurious <i>al fresco</i>
      banquet was set forth, the numerous marble slabs in the vicinity making
      the most delightful substitutes for tables imaginable, and the epitaphs
      and inscriptions forming an agreeable mental repast after the grosser
      bodily appetites had been subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Messrs. Compagnoni, on this occasion, surpassed themselves, and the
      black-puddings, and other funereal delicacies&mdash;served on
      (brass)-plates&mdash;were decorated with "In memory of," "Requiescat in
      pace," and other appropriate mottoes calculated to raise the spirits of
      the party, and promote hilarity in the highest degree. Old Elmplank said
      he hadn't had such a lively time, or felt in such good spirits, since the
      measles were around that time three years. Meanwhile the young folks were:
      enjoying themselves, and fun and flirtation wore carried on in a decorous
      manner, out of respect to the emblems of mortality by which they were
      surrounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      An amiable young coffin-maker, with the most fascinating hearse-suit
      appendages, made great inroads on the heart of Miss Grace Bugles. He
      requested her to enter his heart, which he compared to an unoccupied tomb,
      and reside there rent free. Should love like his, he asked, be "coffined,
      cribbed, confined" within the narrow limits of a flannel waistcoat? No; he
      invited her to come to his arms, shroud herself in his bosom, and stop the
      process of cremation which was going on in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Songs and recitations were in the programme. Miss Bugles sang "Those
      funeral bells," and "The old elm tree," and her admirer gave them a
      Bacchanalian, or rather a coffin-nailian ditty, with a chorus of "Bier,
      bier, beautiful bier," and a skull and thigh-bones accompaniment, which
      provoked thunders of applause; and when old Tassels, of the mourning
      livery-stables sang,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "But one golden tress of her hair I'll twine
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In my hearse's sable plume,"
    </p>
    <p>
      there was scarcely a dry eye in the assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no healths drunk, such a custom being considered out of
      character with the proceedings, and not conducive to the prosperity of
      business generally. Undertakers who were sociably disposed took each
      other's measures, composed epitaphs, and talked about cremation. Old
      Elmplank, in his speech, said that any allusion to such a mode of
      disposing of the dead wounded him to the quick. "Introduce that process,"
      he said, "and the whole romance of a funeral was done away with. The
      invention," he added, "was worthy of a cove as was mean enough to drink
      another cove's ealth." But even undertakers cannot keep up at the
      high-pressure pitch of hilarity for ever, and as evening drew on, the rain
      having been falling heavily for several hours, the cemetery was by common
      consent voted damp, and a general move was made for the railway station.
      The party returned to Sydney, well satisfied with their outing, and the
      number of colds caught must have made business lively for the next six
      months.

    <h2>
      THE HAIRDRESSERS' PIC-NIC.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>VEN barbers
      require change of (h)air occasionally; consequently there were no
      dissentient voices when Potts proposed an excursion, and suggested the
      Gap, where the "yesty waves" seem never to tire of their monotonous
      occupation of shampooing the South Head. The pic-nic took place eventually
      among the romantic glades in the immediate vicinity of Pearl (-powder)
      Bay, where the "maidenhair" (capillis veneris) grew luxuriantly&mdash;having
      been neither cut by the north-east wind, nor brushed by machinery&mdash;while
      the rabbit and false-hare frisked fearlessly among solitudes seldom
      disturbed by the presence of man, and that beautiful bird the
      antimacassowary flew with well-oiled pinions from branch to branch of the
      Eucalipsalve.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be imagined by ignorant people that hairdressers, who pay so much
      attention to the adornment of the outward man, would be apt to forget the
      requirements of the inner entirely; this, however, was not the case,
      jugged hairs and barbercues being among the least of the delicacies
      provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course there were speeches. That old demagogue&mdash;Bearsgrease,
      shampooed, no, pooh! poohed everything, everybody else. Being a wig-maker,
      it was natural that in politics he should be a Whig; and though, as he
      said, he had never appeared as a candidate for Parliamentary honors, or
      been at the head of an electioneering poll, he knew as much about heads
      and polls as some who had.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why enlarge on all this? Can we not imagine how young Potts led Miss
      Glycerina Crimpington for a stroll by the sounding sea, and directed her
      attention to the magnificent crests of the billows, fresh from the
      curling-tongs of Nature, tumbling over one another, and doubling
      themselves into such exquisite "frizettes" and "waterfalls" that they were
      enough to excite envy in the breast of any young lady, especially if she
      happened to be a hair-dresser's daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we not picture to ourselves the thousand and one incidents which go to
      make up what is called a pic-nic? How some were stricken hungry, and
      others sentimental; how some satisfied their cravings with kisses, others
      with pie; how Potts charmed the ear of his adored Crimpington with
      recitations from "Locksley Hall," and the "Hair of Redcliffe;" how the
      young folks danced the Kalydorians (arranged by Rowlands); and last, not
      least, how the old folks got maudlin on limejuice and glycerine, and
      talked of the days when their feet were as light, and their chevleures as
      heavy as those of any young scalp-lock trimmer present We can, I think,
      imagine all this so it will not be necessary to say more than that the
      whole thing was a thorough success, especially Potts's song of "(H)airy
      spirts round us hover," with a comb accompaniment, after which a general
      stampede was made for the boats.

      Gentlest of a proverbially gentle class, what you say is perfectly true;
      but I have excellent precedent for this inconsistency. No one, not even an
      evangelical parson, sticks to his text now-a-days; and the gentleman who
      objected to being told "in mournful numbers" that "things are not what
      they seem," was a self-deceiving visionary who wanted to close his eyes to
      what everyone else knows to be an established fact. An M.P.'s speech on
      free trade seldom alludes to the subject; the daring feats and marvellous
      situations depicted outside a circus are never seen inside; light
      literature, advertised as such, is proverbially heavy; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s
      "Vermin Destroyer" has rather a nutritious and invigorating effect on
      vermin than otherwise, according to my experience; Young's "Night
      Thoughts" were written in broad day-light; and few can have failed to
      remark the absence of pork and the presence of cat in a restaurant
      pork-sausage.

      Did it ever guide anyone anywhere except to outer darkness? Did it ever
      awaken any other feeling in the bosom of a deluded traveller than a thirst
      for revenge? Bradshaw merely followed the universal rule of contraries
      when he christened his mystifying treatise a "guide," for none knew better
      than he that "throwing a light on a subject" means involving it in gloom
      and obscurity, as surely as that "just one glass more, and then straight
      home," means twenty, and the most circuitous route the neighbourhood will
      admit of. I trust I have said enough to vindicate the somewhat obscure and
      deceptive title of this book; or, at any rate, to avert the worst
      catastrophe an author can dread&mdash;that of being blown to atoms by a
      Southerly Buster of Public Opinion.
